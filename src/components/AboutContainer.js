          While most of my career has been spent writing front end Javascript
          and React, my full stack role at Wahoo is allowing my Node.js
          knowledge to steadily progress. I have also worked with Java backend
          stacks. I advocate for, and prefer the use of modern Javascript
          features, and the Ecmascript syntax. Most recently at Wahoo, I've
          begun to become familiar with Ruby on Rails, Bitbucket CI/CD, AWS
          Cloud, and SonarQube.

          I support and believe in unit testing. I've held roles where
          developers are responsible for maintaining quality, and I've also
          worked with Quality Assurance departments. I'm also comfortable
          supporting applications in older, less compliant browsers. At
          Sharecare, I played a large part in updating the Health Profile
          section of their Web Application to meet{" "}

          I am truly a problem solver at heart, which lends aptitude towards my
          skills as a developer. Outside of work, I spend hours tackling more
          physical engineering challenges. Mainly working on cars, bicycles, and
          motorbikes.
